Its a simple project where i extract some ecommerce data make some manipulations and output it in csv and parquet and also in AWS and Google BigQuery. Its docker ready project so you can just deploy it in one command.

How to setup:
1. visit https://www.kaggle.com/ make an account and create API key.
2. Install it in C://users/user/.kaggle

Optional if you want to make upload in Cloud you need to setup .env file i have made an example.
For Google Cloud you also need to get an API key and install it somewhere(better in root folder) than set the path in env file and thats all)
